## General Information
- Project Description: The Bike Sharing Assignment investigates the dataset from a bike-sharing company to predict the number of rentals based on various factors.

- Background: Bike-sharing services are increasingly popular, and understanding the patterns and trends in bike rentals helps the company manage operations and optimize for demand. 

- Business Problem: The project addresses the need for demand prediction, helping the company plan its resources, manage bike availability, and make data-driven decisions to improve customer satisfaction.

- Dataset: The dataset includes information on rental counts, weather conditions, seasonality, holidays, weekdays, temperature, and other environmental and operational variables.



## Conclusions
- Fall season seems to have attracted more booking. And, in each season the booking count has increased drastically from 2018 to 2019.  
- Most of the bookings has been done during the month of may, june, july, aug, sep, and oct.
- Clear weather attracted more booking which seems obvious. 
- When itâ€™s not holiday, booking seems to be less in number which seems reasonable as on holidays, people may want to spend time at home and enjoy with family.
